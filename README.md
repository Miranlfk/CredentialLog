# CredentialLog

Welcome to the official Github repository Credential Log. Credential Log is a merkle tree based transparency log utilised to store signature credentials of applications/artifacts signed by the Notation tool. This application hopes to resolve the adoption problem faced with artifact signature tools such as Notation. 

A simple introduction; Notation is an image/artifact signature tool utilised by software suppliers to authenticate their release artifacts/software. Users' retrieving this software who wish to verify its authenticity must, utilise the same Notation tool. In short this application will be another layer on top of Notation signing process, where the signature details will be sent to this log, users who would like to verify the specific software/artifact can make calls to the log independently and obtain the signature credentials and verify their downloaded software.
